Gimme what you got!
I'm the hottest mothafucka on the whole damn block!
Do my thing and the girly girls watch
I'm the hottest mothafucka on the whole damn block!

Slow and steady is the way I rock
I can neck 'em at the box like I'm tryna take facts
I hear 'em talk, these chickens squawk
Bitches all covered in shit 'n salt
Don't break yourself!
I'm just way too hot
Correct, I break necks with the way I walk
I make traffic stop
Take it all off
You know my sugar so sweet, it make your teeth rot
'Cause I get loose and I'm with the juice
Lie all the time, I'm still the truth
You know I get-get loose and I'm with the juice
Droppin' my name in the DJ booth
I got everybody in the front, back-back it up!
Show'em I'm that bitch you call me 'kitsch'
I do it for the kids and Designer drops
I'm so goddamn rich!!

You see me, yeah this is it
I'm puttin' in work, and I live
'Cause I got that 'Ey!', I don't play!
We ain't takin' no shit
I stay-stay livin' out loud
Ba-bangin' hot for the crowd
'Cause I got that road! Watch me roll!
We be turnin' it out
You see me, yeah this is it
I'm puttin' in work, and I live
'Cause I got that 'Ey!', I don't play!
We ain't takin' no shit
I stay-stay livin' out loud
Ba-bangin' hot for the crowd
I go-go-go! Gotta glow like gold-gold-gold!
I'm straight-straight turnin' it ouuuuuuut!

I like em' fresh, big face, big deal
I make a bitch feel rich, how you feel?
What you mad at it?
Say somethin, tweet-tweet, motherfucka
What your little deal?
Still tryna spit, you little rap addict?
Rap addict, addicted to the vision
Third mouth, third dick, spendin' how I'm livin'
King Controversy, call me Prince Nixon
Cool kids, schoolboys think they competition
I'm mentally gifted, you materialistic savage ass niggas
Whinin' and bitchin'
Facts over facts, fools'll be forgotten
You talk, the longer I'm rap tryna ride 'em

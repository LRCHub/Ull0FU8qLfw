Though you may not drive
A great big Cadillac
Gangsta whitewalls
TV antennas in the back

You may not have
A car at all
But remember, brothers and sisters
You can still stand tall

Just be thankful
For what you've got
Though you may not drive
A great big Cadillac

Diamond in the back
Sunroof top
Digging the scene
With a gangsta lean

Gangsta whitewalls
TV antennas in the back

You may not have
A car at all
But remember, brothers and sisters
You can still stand tall

Just be thankful
For what you've got

Diamond in the back
Sunroof top
Digging the scene
With a gangsta lean, ooh

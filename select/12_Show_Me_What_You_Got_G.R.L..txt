(Ay)
(Ay)
You wanna call me baby
You wanna earn my love
You wanna give me everything
That I've been dreaming of
You're dancing all up on me
Expecting something more
But shouldn't I kno-know who you are
If I'm gonna be yours?
Hey boy tell me
Will you be there when I need you
Hey boy tell me
But why should I just believe you?
Don't get me wrong, I'm into you
But I'm just not that girl
So don't just tell me
That you show me what you're made of
(Ay) if you wanna be with me
(Ay) Show me what you go-ot
(Ay) So go ahead and let me see
(Ay) show me what you go-ot
You're trying to get it poppin'
You're trying to change my mind
You're trying to take me home tonight
But you should take your time
And maybe I'm old fashioned
Or maybe you're too fresh
'Cause you could be a billionaire
But that won't get you this
Hey boy tell me
Will you be there when I need you
Hey boy tell me
But why should I just believe you?
Don't get me wrong, I'm into you
But I'm just not that girl
So don't just tell me
That you show me what you're made of
(Ay) if you wanna be with me
(Ay) Show me what you go-ot
(Ay) So go ahead and let me see
(Ay) show me what you go-ot
In case you didn't notice
I think you're really fly
But, baby, show me what you got
What you got inside
Hey boy tell me
Will you be there when I need you
Hey boy tell me
But why should I just believe you?
Don't get me wrong, I'm into you
But I'm just not that girl
So don't just tell me
That you show me what you're made of
(Ay) If you wanna be with me
(Ay) Show me what you go-ot
(Ay) So go ahead and let me see
(Ay) Show me what you go-ot
(Ay) If you wanna be with me
(Ay) Show me what you go-ot
(Ay) So go ahead and let me see
(Ay) Show me what you go-ot

Well, take what you got
And give it a shot
I'm no good at lying
At least that's what I thought
And what does it mean to you, child?
You're so very young, you're empty inside my mind
Well not much is so much more than I could ever know

I'm out of my room
And I'm out of my head
And I'm leaving for good now
At least that's what I said
And all of the things you know, dear
You're taking 'em back
You're watching 'em grow, girl, grow
Well, not much is more than I could ever say

And what does it mean to you, child?
You're so very young, you're empty inside my mind
Well not much is so much more than I could ever know
